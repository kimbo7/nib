## Comparison

Most network security tools **detect and alert** — they assume someone is watching. NIB **detects, blocks, and shares**: Suricata finds threats, CrowdSec blocks them automatically, and the community network means you benefit from attacks detected by millions of other nodes before they reach you.

| | NIB | Security Onion | SELKS | Malcolm | Zeek |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | `make install` | 30-60 min | 15-30 min | 20-30 min | Manual |
| **Auto-blocking** | Yes (CrowdSec) | No | No | No | No |
| **Community intel** | Millions of nodes | No | No | No | No |
| **Router integration** | Built-in | No | No | No | No |
| **RAM** | ~1 GB | 8-16 GB | 4-8 GB | 8-16 GB | ~512 MB |
| **Full PCAP** | No | Yes | Optional | Yes | No |
| **Dashboards** | 4 Grafana | 20+ Kibana | 10+ Scirius | 15+ | None |

For detailed comparisons (when to choose NIB vs when to choose something else), see **[docs/comparison.md](docs/comparison.md)**.

## How It Works

### Data Flow

Suricata runs in Docker with `network_mode: host`, giving it direct access to the host's network interfaces via AF_PACKET (zero-copy kernel capture). It inspects every packet and writes structured JSON events to a shared Docker volume:

```
Network packets on eth0
    │
    ▼
Suricata (AF_PACKET, host network) ──→ /var/log/suricata/eve.json (Docker volume)
                                                │
                                 ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
                                 ▼              ▼              ▼
                           CrowdSec        Vector          fast.log
                           reads EVE       reads EVE       (plain text
                           for attack      for shipping     alert log)
                           patterns        to storage
                                │              │
                                ▼              ▼
                           Firewall       VictoriaLogs ──→ Grafana
                           Bouncer        (query engine)   (dashboards)
                           (iptables
                            DROP)
```

Both CrowdSec and Vector read from the same Docker volume. CrowdSec detects attack patterns (brute force, scans, exploit attempts) and instructs the firewall bouncer to add iptables DROP rules. The bouncer also runs in `network_mode: host` so it directly manipulates the host's iptables.

### Where to Deploy

The key constraint: **Suricata needs to see the traffic**, and **the bouncer needs iptables on a machine where blocking matters**.

#### 1. Linux Router / Gateway (best coverage)

If you have a Linux box as your network gateway, this is the ideal placement. Suricata sees all traffic entering and leaving your network, and iptables blocks happen before packets reach internal hosts.

```
Internet ──→ [NIB on Linux Router] ──→ Internal Network
              Suricata sees ALL        Blocked IPs never
              inbound + outbound       reach internal hosts
```

Works with: a dedicated Linux box, a repurposed PC running Debian/Ubuntu, or any Linux-based firewall.

#### 2. Port Mirror / SPAN (dedicated sensor)

If your router isn't Linux (or you don't want to modify it), configure a SPAN/mirror port on your managed switch to copy all traffic to a dedicated NIB host. Suricata sees everything, but the iptables bouncer only blocks on the NIB host itself.

```
Switch (SPAN port) ──mirror──→ [NIB Sensor]
                                Suricata sees all traffic
                                Bouncer blocks on sensor only
```

To block on your actual firewall, set `BOUNCER_MODE=sensor` in `.env`. This disables the local iptables bouncer and exposes the CrowdSec LAPI so remote bouncers can pull decisions. Then choose how to push bans to your router:

**Native plugin (easiest):** pfSense and OPNsense have CrowdSec packages in their plugin repos. Point them at `http://<nib-host>:8080` with a key from `make add-router-bouncer`.

**Router sync script:** For MikroTik, OpenWrt, or any router with a REST API:

```bash
# In .env
BOUNCER_MODE=sensor
ROUTER_TYPE=mikrotik          # mikrotik, opnsense, pfsense, openwrt, generic
ROUTER_URL=https://192.168.1.1
ROUTER_USER=admin
ROUTER_PASS=your-password

# Start continuous sync
make router-sync-daemon
```

**CDN/cloud:** CrowdSec has official bouncers for Cloudflare, AWS WAF, nginx, and HAProxy — all can pull from your NIB LAPI.

See [crowdsec/README.md](crowdsec/README.md) for detailed setup instructions per router.

#### 3. Individual Server (protect one host)

Run NIB on any Linux server to monitor and protect that specific machine. Suricata only sees traffic to/from that host, but iptables blocking is fully effective since it's on the same machine.

```
Internet ──→ [Web Server with NIB]
              Suricata monitors this host's traffic
              Bouncer blocks attackers at iptables
```

Good for: web servers, API servers, bastion hosts, any internet-facing Linux box.

#### 4. Alongside SIB (defense in depth)

Run both on the same host for complementary coverage:

```
[Host running SIB + NIB]
  SIB (Falco)  → watches syscalls: file access, process execution, container activity
  NIB (Suricata) → watches network: traffic patterns, DNS, TLS, protocol anomalies
```

They don't share anything — separate Docker networks (`sib-network` vs `nib-network`), separate storage, separate Grafana instances (port 3000 vs 3001). You can also point both at a single Grafana by adding the other's datasource.

### Choosing a Network Interface

Set `SURICATA_INTERFACE` in `.env` to the interface carrying the traffic you want to monitor:

```bash
# Find your interfaces
ip link show

# Common examples:
SURICATA_INTERFACE=eth0       # Physical ethernet
SURICATA_INTERFACE=ens33      # VMware / modern Linux naming
SURICATA_INTERFACE=enp0s3     # VirtualBox
SURICATA_INTERFACE=br0        # Bridge interface (router)
SURICATA_INTERFACE=wlan0      # WiFi (limited - no promiscuous mode on most drivers)
```

For a router/gateway, use the **LAN-facing interface** to see internal traffic, or the **WAN-facing interface** to see external threats, or a **bridge interface** to see both.

## How It Works With SIB

NIB and SIB complement each other:

- **SIB** monitors what happens **inside** your hosts (syscalls, file access, process execution)
- **NIB** monitors what happens **on the network** (traffic, DNS, TLS, attacks)

They can run side by side. Use separate Grafana instances (SIB on port 3000, NIB on port 3001) or combine dashboards into a single Grafana by pointing one at both storage backends.

## Security Notes

- Suricata runs with `network_mode: host` and elevated capabilities for packet capture
- CrowdSec's firewall bouncer needs `NET_ADMIN` to manage iptables rules
- VictoriaLogs is bound to localhost by default (`STORAGE_BIND=127.0.0.1`)
- CrowdSec API is bound to localhost by default
- Grafana has anonymous access disabled, sign-up disabled
- Admin password is auto-generated on first `make install`

## Troubleshooting

### Suricata not capturing traffic

```bash
# Check the interface name
ip link show

# Verify Suricata sees packets
make shell-suricata
suricatasc -c "iface-stat default" /var/run/suricata/suricata-command.socket
```

### No alerts in Grafana

```bash
# Trigger a test alert
make test-alert

# Check Vector is shipping logs
make logs-vector

# Check VictoriaLogs received data
curl -s "http://localhost:9428/select/logsql/query?query=*&limit=5"
```

### CrowdSec bouncer not blocking

```bash
# Check bouncer is connected
make bouncer-status

# Check active decisions
make decisions

# Check iptables rules
sudo iptables -L crowdsec-blacklists -n
```
